Simple Explanation about Classes :


By my Architecture understanding i have design 4 Classes for this problem.
This is a Multi threading problem , where i have used my concepts of Threads, not using the new concepts packages on Java 7.
My approach to this problem was considering 3 main Entities: Message, Gateway, Resource.

Resource is an Entity where is locked and will notify Gateway.

Gateway aggregates the Message object, and is locked with the Resource Entity.

Message all the attributes about Message.  

ResourceSchedular is a static class that uses, Singleton Pattern. 
Shares the number of total Resources that can be configurable. Handles with Message Queue.
Prioritize the Messages by GroupID using a Queue structure.
